# racist_o_meter

Mobile app based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XosEdKikOAc).

## Idea
Detect racism and hateful speech using OpenAI's ChatGPT

This app receives a sentence, phrase, statement, etc. from the microphone and replies whether what you said is racist or not, and gives an explanation of its answer.
