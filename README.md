# racist-o-meter

Mobile app based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XosEdKikOAc).

[Repository for the backend](https://github.com/juanstakys/racist_o_meter_backend).

## Idea
Detect racism and hateful speech using OpenAI's ChatGPT

This app receives a sentence, phrase, statement, etc. from the microphone and replies whether what you said is racist or not, and gives an explanation of its answer.

## Screenshots

View when racist discourse is detected:

### Info icon

When you click the info icon you get an explanation on why the detected discourse is racist:

If the detected discourse is not racist, you get an explanation too on why it is not racist:
